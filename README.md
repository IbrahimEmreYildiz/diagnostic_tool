## üìò About the Project
This project was developed for the **CEN322 ‚Äì Network Programming** course.  
It demonstrates the use of **TCP/UDP sockets**, **client‚Äìserver communication**, and **time synchronization** using Python.  

The tool works as a small **network diagnostic system** that can:
- Display machine and network information  
- Perform echo (connection) tests  
- Synchronize time with an SNTP server  
- Enable basic chat communication between two users  
- Test socket errors and timeout handling  

All modules are combined and controlled from a single menu in **`main.py`**.
